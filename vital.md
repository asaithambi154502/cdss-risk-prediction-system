The system is enhanced to collect and analyze a broader set of vital signs to provide more accurate and clinically meaningful medical error risk predictions. In addition to core parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation, the system can incorporate additional clinical indicators like blood sugar level, body weight, body mass index (BMI), pain score, and level of consciousness. These inputs offer a more complete view of the patient’s physiological condition.

To ensure data reliability and patient safety, each vital sign is validated using medically acceptable ranges before processing. Friendly input guidance and range checks prevent unrealistic values from being entered (for example, ensuring body temperature remains within human limits). Visual indicators and simple warning messages help users quickly identify abnormal or critical values.

By combining extended vital sign coverage with proper range validation and a professional user interface, the system becomes more robust, accurate, and suitable for real-world clinical environments, supporting healthcare professionals with clearer and safer decision-making.
