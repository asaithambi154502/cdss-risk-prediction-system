This project proposes an Intelligent Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying and preventing medical risks through machine learning, explainable AI (XAI), and adaptive alert prioritization.

Unlike traditional CDSS prototypes that only provide a risk score, the proposed system integrates:

Explainable AI (SHAP/LIME) to clearly justify why a patient is classified as low, medium, or high risk by highlighting contributing clinical factors such as age, laboratory results, and medication interactions.

A Smart Alert Fatigue Reduction Module that dynamically prioritizes alerts into low, medium, and critical levels to avoid overwhelming clinicians with unnecessary warnings.

A FHIR-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) data simulation layer, enabling the system to accept structured patient data in standardized healthcare formats.

A Unified Multi-Risk Prediction Engine capable of detecting medication error risk, disease risk, adverse event risk, and hospital readmission risk within a single framework.

The system combines hybrid intelligence, using both machine learning predictions and rule-based clinical safety checks to improve accuracy and reliability. The application is deployed as a web-based platform, making it accessible for real-time clinical decision support.

This project aims to improve patient safety, enhance clinical transparency, and reduce preventable medical errors while maintaining compatibility with modern healthcare informatics standards.
